# Advent of Code 2023

I'll solve some of the advent of code 2023 problems in Rust to get a better
feel for the language than my usual numerical simulation projects.

I will not try to solve the problems without any help and will be seeking
blatant inspiration from people I believe to be both good programmers and
serious Rust programmers to attempt to get a feel of "best practices",
even though I believe that term is nebulous in any language.

As it stands currently, I do not intend for this project to be easily
runnable by anyone but me on my machine.
